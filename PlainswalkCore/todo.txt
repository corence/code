concepts:
 - priority
 - select -- choose a Card, with conditions. This is Target without the Target (previously Focus). eg, Clone's comes-into-play ability
 - the stack: this contains cards. each card has 0 or 1 "resolve" abilities -- these can only be activated by the stack.
 - markers -- these are Counters without the counters
 - effects -- each entry in the right-hand-side of an ability. eg, Cast, Tether, Deal Damage. (Previously called Acts)
 - Type and Subtype -- cards inherit implicit rules from these (which can be overridden)
 - card -- this can be a physical card or a token. Some things that are cards: the player, everything in any zone including the stack
 - Everything is a card -- even markers. omg.
 - A Card has:
   -- name
   -- mana cost
   -- isToken
   -- types
   -- subtypes
   -- abilities
   -- triggers (these are probably ongoings)
   -- ongoings (these probably include state-based effects)
   -- power
   -- toughness
   -- face up / face down (?) [pretty sure this is an emblem]
   -- current zone (?) [probably attach the zone to a card]
   -- tapped (?) [pretty sure this is an emblem]
   -- attachments

core rules:
 - activated abilities: meet the conditions, pay the costs, and execute the ability (which might put something on the stack, or anything else)
 - ongoing effects
 - surrender -- this player loses the game.
 - player card?

NOT core rules:
 - initial battlefield setup -- each player just starts with a deck list, nothing more
 - instants can be played any time
 - creatures and players die from too much damage or poison
 - step() { remove a step from the Step Queue } -- these are all built-in to Step cards as triggered abilities as part of the sequence (after priority is completed), and Steps are always controlled by the current player
 - steps advance through the Step Queue
 - turns advance through the Turn Queue
 - the stack (and all other zones -- these are cards)
 - priority (this is all printed on step cards)
 - jet lag, in-combat, tap to attack, damage resolution (these are Emblems or printed on the combat step cards)
 - Morphed status -- that's an emblem

step effects:
 - at the beginning of your untap step, clear all jet lag emblems from permanents you control
 - at the beginning of the Declare Attackers step, choose any number of permanents you control with the following conditions: (no 
 - untap: Trigger all beginning-of-turns. Untap Everything. Conclude Step. [note: the Jet Lag emblem attaches a stackless Clear All Jet Lag Emblems trigger to this -- all triggers here are stackless, i think.]
 - upkeep: Trigger all upkeep triggers. Priority. Conclude Step.
 - draw: Draw. Conclude Step.
 - main: activatable ability: tether land. activatable ability: combat. activatable ability: Priority. activatable ability: Conclude Step.
 - combat: (this puts a bunch of cards on top of the turn stack)
 - declare attackers: choose any number of opponents. for each chosen opponent, choose any number of cards with the following conditions: (permanent) (controlled by me) (no jet lag) (untapped) (no defender). each of these gets a Combat emblem and an Attacker emblem with the defender selected. The attacker and Combat emblems both have conditions for detaching -- such as regeneration or changing zones.
 - declare blockers: priority. Each attacked player declares blockers (choose any number of cards with the following conditions: (permanent) (controlled by them) (untapped), and for each of these, choose an attacking creature with the following conditions: (attacking the right player) (able to block) and attach a Defending (permament ID) emblem.
 - Damage (first strike only) step
 - Damage (not first strike) step
 - End combat step
 
zone effects:
 - when a card changes zones, clear all counters from it
 - when a card leaves the battlefield, detach its instance
 - when a card enters the battlefield, attach a jet lag emblem
 - when a card on the battlefield changes controller, attach a jet lag emblem
 - when a card enters the battlefield, create an Instance and attach that to it. This instance can be rebuilt at any time and consists of the creature's effective abilities + stats after all replacement effects are applied.
 - when a card leaves the battlefield, abandon its instance

ability effects:
 - Haste: Whenever jet lag is attached to this card, detach it.
 - Vigilance: During the Declare Attackers step, if this card would tap, don't.

things that have cards:
 - the player
 - turns, phases, and steps

things that use markers:
 - damage
 - life
 - mana
 - (possibly) current power/toughness/indestructibles
 - (possibly) kicker
 - hand capacity

some effects:
 - Tether -- Move this card to the battlefield.
 - Cast -- Move this card to the stack.
 - Draw -- If your library is empty, you lose the game. Otherwise, move one card from your Library to your hand. (stackless)
 - Discard -- Die(choose a card in your hand).
 - Die (card) -- Move the card to the graveyard.
 - Sacrifice -- Sacrifice (choose a permanent).
 - Sacrifice (selection) -- The creature Dies.
 - Choose (options) -- given a set of options, pick one.
 - Decide (range) -- pick a number within the range.
 - Select (conditions) -- Choose a card, filtered by the conditions.
 - Target (thing) -- select a thing. (this will trigger some side-effects).
 - Pay Mana -- If it has an X, Decide it, then Pay Mana the result. Otherwise, Consume mana the amount.
 - X Mana -- choose an amount, then consume it.
 - Consume mana (colors) -- Sacrifice matching mana from your mana pool. If you can't, Invalidate.
 - Invalidate -- a game rule has been violated; we need to backtrack or abort.
 - Summon -- move this card to the battlefield. (also used for artifacts and enchantments)
 - Spawn (card, zone) -- Creates a token which is a copy of the given card, in the given zone.
 - Lose -- This player loses the game.
 - Attach(selection) -- this must be a permanent. if either card changes zones, abort or detach. record the attachment. this triggers some onAttach logic. both things get some onMove detach logic.

some ongoing effects:
 - Silence -- No abilities can be activated. (If an ability would be activated, instead Invalidate.) This is probably core.
 - "Nonbasic lands are Mountains." --> ReplaceCardAttribute(conditions, attribute, replacement) --> ReplaceCardAttribute("permanent + land + ! basic land", "card template", template["Mountain"])
 - "You can't lose the game by having 0 or less life." --> ReplaceCardAttribute("you", "ongoing: PlayerDie", "")
 - Players can't gain life. --> AddCardAttribute("player", "ongoing:
