 - permanents, tokens (copy a card, attach it)
 - replacement effects

- layer 2: kicker and multikicker

- layer 2: Giant Growth on Grizzly Bears; Lightning Bolt on player; Blood Artist
 - APNAP
 - zone cards; moving between zones triggers things
 - Resolve effect
 - priority (this is an effect; it depends on The Stack, but it's referenced by step cards)
 - player cards
 - blood artist (replacement effects that affect other units)
 - damage (emblems + counters); life
 - lethal damage

- layer 3: Advanced rules. Everflowing Chalice; Flicker to avoid Explosive Growth and shake off enchants and equipment. Illuminate, Pollen Remedy, Orim's Chant, Goblin Bushwhacker, Vigorous Charge, Onna Stick, whenever casts.

 - turn order and looping turns (probably emblem: when this turn ends, put another one on the end of the turn queue)
 - combat rules (the core parts that are on step cards and emblems)
 - combat damage

- layer 4:
 - game initialization -- the card of Starting The Game. this will be triggered as the very first ability, and it will be the only card
 - card abilities: Haste, Flash, Flashback, Domain, Islandwalk, Lifelink (doesn't stack!!)
 - other effects: Discard (in various forms), Regenerate (attaches a death-replacement emblem), 
 - Fireball -- X cost and excessive conditionals (or you could make it a Multikicker like Comet Storm)
 - emblemic rules: jet lag emblems, life and poison counters (and losing the game from these)
 - +1/+1 counters (this is emblemic too)
 - fog -- combat damage prevention (likely an emblem)
 - healing salve -- damage prevention (likely an emblem per point of damage)
 - Protection

- layer 5:
