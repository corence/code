potential new zones. Some of them will likely be culled.

the Queue:
 - when you do a complex action like casting a spell, that spawns multiple actions in sequence, they go here.
 - state-based actions might happen in this zone.

the Substack:
 - when game events are interrupting each other they go here.

the trigger pool:
 - simultaneous triggers all fall here. Whenever this zone is non-empty, players in apnap order must select a trigger to resolve.


When a player would gain priority, something like this will happen:
 - the trigger pool must be cleared
 - the substack must be cleared
 - the queue must be cleared
 - after that, the player gets some choices about what's currently on the stack.

the mana pool:
 - contains Mana card tokens. Some of them have special restrictions; most don't. Cards can be sacrificed from this zone.
