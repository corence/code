rite of flame	R	R,RR,RRR,RRRR	Y	Y	N	N
desperate ritual	1R	RRR	Y	Y	N	N
double desperates	11RR	RRRRRR	Y	Y	N	N

manamorph	1X	XX	Y	Y	Y	N

seething	2R	RRRRR	Y	Y	N	N

 - lion's eye can only trigger during a wish, or a redraw, or to fire the belcher
 - chrome mox needs to junk a card -- probably leave it out for bot v1
 - double desperates replaces a desperate ritual when you have 11RR in flux
 - land grant doesn't generate mana in multiples

super
warren: count the Cast this turn, and double that = goblins
wish: tutor warren, redraw, or flashback
redraw: discard all, draw 7
flashback: all sorc currently in the graveyard gain flashback
belcher: 3 mana to win



stages:
1) mulligan?
2) cast all street wraiths
3) eval each goal and figure out how far to each
3a) warren: we can do at least 3R, and cast at least 4 in turn 1, 5 in turn 2, 6 in turn 3+, and we have warren
3b) we can do 7 mana and we have a belch
3c) we can do 4 mana this turn and 3 mana next turn -- that's a belch
3d) wish: we can do at least 4RR, and we have wish
3e) wish-warren: we can cast at least 4 times in turn 1, 5 in turn 2, 6 in turn 3+
3f) wish-reset: we can convert 4RR to 3RBB, and we haven't done wish-reset
3g) wish-flames: we can generate 4RRR, we have another win-con (or wish) in hand or a sorc in graveyard, and we can fund it if we flash back
4) willingness to risk starting early: 
4a) a goal is only n mana short (either kickstart or sustained mana)
4b) we have x card-draw spells in hand
4c) it's now turn t
4d) on turn 1, we need x >= n + 2
4e) on turn 2, we need x >= n + 1
4f) on turn 4+, we need x >= n
5) we can do x mana if there is a clear path to casting it
6) if we didn't start, then wait


priority:
a) if we're uncertain about starting storm, then all non-sorc get +realtime priority
b) if we're planning to keep going next turn, then prioritize a) permanent mana, getting to the exact mana amount
c) if we're planning to redraw, lower priority on X mana sources (manamorphose, lotus petal)

always function:
elvish spirit guide
simian sprit guide
street wraith
lotus petal
gitax probe

simple conditions:
land grant
lion's eye
tinder wall
pyretic
manamorph
seething

bigger conditions:
chrome mox
rite of flame
desperate ritual

super:
warren
wish
belcher
flasher
resetter

sample hand:
 - land grant
 - burning wish
 - rite of flame
 - manamorphose
 - manamorphose
 - elvish spirit guide
 - seething song

mana: elvish spirit => G, land grant => GY, rite of flame => GRR, seething => RRRRR... 5 mana
 
goals:
3a) warren: no
3b) belch-now: no
3c) belch-next: no
3d) wish: -1 ~2
3e) wish-warren: -1 ~2, storm 7
3f) wish-reset: -1 ~2
3g) wish-flames: -2 ~2, but no following goal

too risky to try for wish-warren, so wait

draw:
 - lotus petal

mana: elvish spirit => G, land grant => GY, rite of flame => GRR, seething => RRRRR, lotus => XRRRRR
 
goals:
3a) warren: no
3b) belch-now: no
3c) belch-next: no
3d) wish: 0 ~2
3e) wish-warren: 0 ~2, storm 8
3f) wish-reset: 0 ~2
3g) wish-flames: -1 ~2, but no following goal
